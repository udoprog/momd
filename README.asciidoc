NAME
----
momd - Modular Media Daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
momd is a highly modular set of media daemons, which support playback for a range of
available formats.

Each component communicates with each other to achieve their specific goal, which
yields to a highly modular design.

momd instances are managed using the mom command.

BUILDING
--------

Building momd requires a c++11 capable compiler, it has only been tested with the
following.

  - g++-4.7 - GNU GCC version 4.7

To setup cmake to use another compiler, do the following when configuring (assuming you have g++-4.7 installed on your system).

--------------------------------------
#> export CXX=g++4.7-<version>
#> cmake .
--------------------------------------

SUPPORTED FORMATS
-----------------

  - _libflac_ - flac
  - _libvorbis_ - ogg
  - _libmpg123_ - mp3, mp4

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------
momd is setup with a set of services, these are.

  - _main_ - Synchronization and intercommunication service.
  - _medialib_ - The media library service.
  - _decoder_ - The audo decoder service.
  - _output_ - The output service.

Each service is connected to a set of zeromq sockets, the one socket they have in
common is the 'management' socket which accepts commands and returns service status
messages.

PROTOCOL
--------
The service protocol utiilizes varying length msgpack messages.

Each frame is packed inside of a frame_container consisting of.

type (integer):: Message type.
payload (string):: Message payload.

The payload is a msgpacked string of the designated type.

The same protocol is utilized by the mom command to communicate with momd.
